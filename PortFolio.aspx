     <p><a href="http://www.landis-ii.org/">Landis-ii</a> is a modular simulation platform that predicts changes in tree species and size composition in the face of growth and desturbances.
     I developed a module for landis that deals with growth and competition amongst trees that was recently published in xxxx. More recently, I developed 
     a more elegant user interface than that was currently available for landis.
