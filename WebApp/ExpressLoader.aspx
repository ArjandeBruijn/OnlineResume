             Express Loader (EL) is a tool for securely loading large amounts of data into a Pipeline Open Data Standards database. 
             PODS is an industry standard for pipeline databases that fascilitates data transfer between pipeline companies and 
             quality compiance reporting to the government. 

             <br><br>
            EL maps data tables from sources like excell, microsoft access files, RDBMS onto target PODS standart compliant 
            databases and enabling the user to associate source data columns to columns in the target database or create logical 
            expressions to populate data entries required by PODS.
  
            <br><br>
            EL is an ongoing development as requirements and preferences of the industry change.  
            I am responsible for maintaining and debugging the software as well as implementing new features.
