             The PODS Staging.Admin tool is used in a data review process used by large 
             midstream oil and gas companies to maintain data quality standards. PODS.Stagins supports:

             <br> <br> 

             <li> Administrators to assign data quality control managers (gatekeepers).</li>
             <li> Gatekeepers to review, accept or reject data submission packages  </li>
          
             <br> 
        
             The PODS Staging tool is a web application that connects a front end web user interface, to server side C# code that
             is used to connect to an ORACLE database via a REST service. My contribution to the Staging.Admin tool was to add an option 
             for the user to select data through pie charts that display relevant selections of data (i.e. per gatekeeper, per duration 
             a project has been idle, etc.). Additionally, I worked to make the code more appliant to the DRY (do not repeat yourself)
             coding standart by using page templates, reusing the strings that are defined in the C# code to form SQL commands, etc.
