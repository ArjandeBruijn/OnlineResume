              Midstream oil and gas companies use the PODS Staging.Admin tool to maintain data quality standards through
               a data review process that determines different levels of priviliges for users of a corporate database.
               Typically, third party contractors submit data into a 
                copy of the database structure under a different database schema. This enables the contractee to 
               evaluate submitted data before copying it into their production database.

              The PODS Staging tool is a web application that connects 
              
              a front end web user interface, to server side C# code that connects to an ORACLE or SQL server database via a REST service. 
              I redesigned the application to give users a better overview of their data. I improved code robustness by reducing the amount of code through  
              the use of page templates and reusing the strings that are defined in the C# code to form SQL commands Finally, I improved performance by 
              storing some of the data retrieved from the database into the cache of the server, reducing the need for some of the 
              sql commands.
