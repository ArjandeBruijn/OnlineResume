                <h3>Accomplishments</h3>
                <p>    
                    Developed a new spatially explicit simulation model, “PnET-Succession”, with user interface to simulate growth
                    and spread of tree species and associated forest carbon sequestration. Developed a user interface that
                    embeds GIS functionality.
