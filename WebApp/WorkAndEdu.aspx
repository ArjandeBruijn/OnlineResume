                    PURDUE UNIVERSITY 
                    Responsibilities
                    Software developer of ecological simulation tools. Code debugging.
                    Accomplishments
                    Developed a new spatially explicit simulation model, “PnET-Succession”, with user interface to simulate growth
                    and spread of tree species and associated forest carbon sequestration. Developed a user interface that
                    embeds GIS functionality.

                    Accomplishments
                    Developed a 1D simulation model to simulate biomass and carbon dynamics in lowland grasslands in
                    Switzerland.

                    Supporting the development of ecological simulation software
                    Accomplishments
                    Improved the Landscape ecological Analysis and Rules for the Configuration of Habitat (LARCH) model user
                    interface which is a plug-in for ArcMap to analyse population viability given fragmented habitat.
                    Expanded functionality of the metapopulation simulation model (METAPHOR) interface which operates as a
                    standalone Windows program that uses GIS freeware to embed GIS capabilities into the program interface.

                    Supporting the development of ecological simulation software
                    Accomplishments
                    Developed a 1D model subroutine DECONIT that was published as an isolated program and later embedded
                    in a larger modelling platform MoBiLE.
