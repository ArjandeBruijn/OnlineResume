                <h2>PURDUE UNIVERSITY  - West-Lafayett, IN - 2011 to 2014</h2>

                <h3>Responsibilities</h3>
                <p>
                    I developed simulations to predict the fate of reintroduced American Chestnut in the Appalachians. By the mid 1900s, American chestnut 
                    was extirpated by a blight that was imported from Japan in the early 1900s. 

                    Asian chestnuts are largely resistant, and recent cross breads (genetically 94% American and 6% Asian) share blight resistance,
                    therefore are candidates for reintroduction. 
                    However, the Appalachians have changed over the last 100 years due to insect plagues, changes in management and climate. 
                    I am combining information from lab and field trials, with landschape information to predict how the blight-resistant breed would 
                    fare upon its reintroduction in the Appalachions.
                    
                    
                </p>


                <h3>Accomplishments</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Developed a module for the <a href="http://www.landis-ii.org/">LANDIS</a>   simulation platform  that better incorporates interactions between climate change and 
                        competition for light and water between trees. LANDIS is windows software developed in C#. It took a lot of mathematics, statistics 
                        and foremost a lot of debugging to get PnET-Succession going and we frequently use other tools to test parts of the code. 
                        I learned a lot of C#, Visual Studio 2010, 2013, R and some python. PnET-Succession is currently used in ~5 universities and the food and agricultural organisation (FAO) of the United Nations. </li>
                        <li>PnET-Succession comes with an installation file I developed in <a href="http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php">INNO</a>, so I am experienced in the issues that come with transplanting software to other computers. </li>
                        <li>PnET-Succession comes with comprehensive technical documentation that I have kept up to date during the development process.</li>
                        <li>Additionally I developed a user interface (see <a href="Portfolio.aspx">Portfolio</a>), originally for my own convenience
                        but it is now used by ~10 users in 3 or 4 universities so I am experienced in developing windows forms applications. The user interface uses threading and backgroundworkers to load maps and data.</li>
