                <h2>PURDUE UNIVERSITY  - West-Lafayett, IN - 2011 to 2014</h2>

                <h3>Responsibilities</h3>
                <p>
                    I developed simulations to predict the fate of reintroduced American Chestnut ion the Appalachians. By the mid 1900s, American chestnut 
                    was extirpated by a blight that was imported from Japan in the early 1900s. 
                    Asian chestnuts (that evolved with the blight) are largely resistant, and recent cross breads that look the same as American chestnut,
                    maintained that resistance, which enables reintroduction of American chesnut. 
                    However, because almost a century has passed, we don't know much about the ecology of chesnut. Moreover, the appalachians are changing fast due to other insects, changes in management 
                    over the last 100 years and climate change. So I am doing simulations that predict their survival (or demise) in the current state of the Appalachians. 
                </p>


                <h3>Accomplishments</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Developed an extension to the spatial forest dynamics model 'Landis' that better incorporates current and ongoing changes such as climate change and 
                        competition for light and water between the trees. The PnET-Succession extension, like the rest of the LANDIS model, is programmed in C#. It took a lot of mathematics, statistics 
                        and foremost a lot of code debugging to get that extension going and we frequently use other tools to test parts of the code so I am very experienced in C#, Visual Studio 2010, 2013, 
                        R and some python. PnET-Succession is currently used in ~5 universities and the food and agricultural organisation (FAO) of the United Nations. </li>
                        <li>It comes with a setup procedure developed in INNO, so I am experienced in the issues that come with transplanting software to other computers. </li>
                        <li>It also comes with comprehensive technical documentation that I have kept up to date during the development process.</li>
                        <li> Additionally I developed a user interface (see Portfolio), originally for convenience but it is now used by ~10 users in 3 or 4 universities so I am experienced in developing windows forms 
                              applications. The user interface uses threading and backgroundworkers to load maps and data.</li>
                  </ul>
