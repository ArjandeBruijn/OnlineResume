                <h3>Responsibilities</h3>
                <p>
                    I developed simulations to predict the fate of reintroduced American Chestnut in the Appalachians. By the mid 1900s, American chestnut 
                    was extirpated by a blight that was imported from Japan in the early 1900s. 

                    Asian chestnuts are largely resistant, and recent cross breads (genetically 94% American and 6% Asian) share blight resistance,
                    therefore are candidates for reintroduction. 
                    However, the Appalachians have changed over the last 100 years due to insect plagues, changes in management and climate. 
                    I am combining information from lab and field trials, with landschape information to predict how the blight-resistant breed would 
                    fare upon its reintroduction in the Appalachions.

                <h3>Accomplishments</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Developed a module for the <a href="http://www.landis-ii.org/">LANDIS</a>   simulation platform  that better incorporates interactions between climate change and 
                        competition for light and water between trees. LANDIS is windows software developed in C#. It took a lot of mathematics, statistics 
                        and foremost a lot of debugging to get PnET-Succession going and we frequently use other tools to test parts of the code. 
                        I learned a lot of C#, Visual Studio 2010, 2013, R and some python. PnET-Succession is currently used in ~5 universities and the food and agricultural organisation (FAO) of the United Nations. </li>
                        <li>PnET-Succession comes with an installation file I developed in <a href="http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php">INNO</a>, so I am experienced in the issues that come with transplanting software to other computers. </li>
                        <li>PnET-Succession comes with comprehensive technical documentation that I have kept up to date during the development process.</li>
                        <li>Additionally I developed a user interface (see <a href="Portfolio.aspx">Portfolio</a>), originally for my own convenience
                        but it is now used by ~10 users in 3 or 4 universities so I am experienced in developing windows forms applications. The user interface uses threading and backgroundworkers to load maps and data.</li>

                <h3>Responsibilities</h3>
                <p>
                    I developed simulations to evaluate how differences in soil carbon in grasslands relates to management intensity.
                    Carbon is the main consituent of dead organic materials, for example plants or harvest residues.
                    High carbon concentrations in arable lands are good for soil fertility, water retention and mitigation of climate change.
                    Here I evaluated how soil Carbon concentrations depend on management activity and intensity.

                <p>   
                    Developed a 1D simulation model to simulate biomass and carbon dynamics in lowland grasslands in Switzerland. The simulation model was developed in C++ and 
                    came with a simple windows forms based UI.

                    I supported the development of a beogeochemical simulation platform "MoBiLE". MoBiLE is a modular plpatform for biogeochemical 
                    simulations where the modules are responsible for particular soil biogeochemical unities, like soil water, soil temperature, plant growth, microbial 
                    biomass, biochemistry and chemistry. I developed a module that deals with the microbial biomass part of the platform.

                <p>
                    At Wageningen University, it was pretty common to design an individual program for graduation. There were strickt demands for an individual study plan 
                    based on coherence of the subjects that you follow and the intellectual level of the plan as a whole. 
                    
                    I usually refer to my program at Wageningen University as "Mathematical Ecology", meaning that I had a large amound of mathematics, statistics and quantitative
                    ecology in my program. I combined my study at Wageningen University with a study of Philosophy of Science at Amsterdam University. 
                    My study program at Wageningen University consisted of 5 year * 42 credits per year. And Amersterdam University of 4 years * 42 credits per year. 
                    However, many credits are waived due to the double master. My combined study program therefore was only 6 * 42 credits.
