        <h3>Responsibilities</h3>
            
            I developed simulations to predict the fate of reintroduced American chestnut trees in the Appalachians. By the mid-1900s, American chestnut was wiped out by a blight that was imported from Japan in the early 1900s. 
            Asian chestnuts are largely resistant, and recent cross breeds (genetically 94% American and 6% Asian) share blight resistance, therefore are candidates for reintroduction. 
            However, the Appalachians have changed over the last 100 years due to insect plagues and changes in land management and climate. 
            I am combining information from lab and field trials with databases such as USGS geo data portal to predict how the new blight-resistant breed would fare upon its reintroduction in the Appalachians.

            
        <h3>Accomplishments</h3>
        <ul>
           <li>Developed a module, PnET-Succession, for the LANDIS-II Forest Landscape Simulation Model simulation platform that better incorporates interactions between climate change and competition for light and water between trees. LANDIS is Windows software developed in C# using Visual Studio. PnET-Succession is currently used in several universities and the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations. </li>
           <li>Wrote comprehensive technical documentation that I have kept up to date during the development process.</li>
           <li>Additionally I developed a user interface (see <a href="Portfolio.aspx">Portfolio</a>) as a Windows Forms application. The user interface uses techniques like multithreading and BackgroundWorkers to load maps and data. </li>

     <h3>Responsibilities</h3>
      
        I developed simulations to evaluate how differences in soil carbon in grasslands relates to management intensity.
        <!--Carbon is the main consituent of dead organic materials, for example plants or harvest residues.
        High carbon concentrations in arable lands are good for soil fertility, water retention and mitigation of climate change.
        Here I evaluated how soil Carbon concentrations depend on management activity and intensity. -->
     
     <h3>Accomplishments</h3>
     <p>   
        Developed a 1D simulation model to simulate biomass and carbon dynamics in lowland grasslands in Switzerland. The simulation model was developed in C++ and 
        came with a simple windows forms based UI.

            I debugging and improving various simulation programs. I mostly worked on the Landscape ecological Analysis and Rules for the Configuration of Habitat (LARCH) model.
            LARCH analyse population viability given fragmented habitat. It was used for all kinds of species, plants and animals.

        <h3>Responsibilities</h3>
        <p> 
            I supported the development of a biogeochemical simulation platform "MoBiLE". MoBiLE is a modular plpatform for biogeochemical 
            simulations where the modules are responsible for particular soil biogeochemical unities, like soil water, soil temperature, plant growth, microbial 
            biomass, biochemistry and chemistry. I developed a module that deals with the microbial biomass part of the platform.

                    Developed a 1D model subroutine DECONIT that was published as an isolated program and later embedded

     <h3>Study themes</h3>   
     <p>
        At Wageningen University, it was pretty common to design an individual program for graduation. There were strickt demands for an individual study plan 
        based on coherence of the subjects that you follow and the intellectual level of the plan as a whole. 
        I usually refer to my program at Wageningen University as "Mathematical Ecology", meaning that I had a large amound of mathematics, statistics and quantitative
        ecology in my program. I combined my study at Wageningen University with a study of Philosophy of Science at Amsterdam University.
