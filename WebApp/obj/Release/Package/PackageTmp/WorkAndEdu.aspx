    I worked with the United States Forest Service since 2011 during Post-Doctoral assignment

    <h3>Responsibilities</h3>
            
        By the mid-1900s, American chestnut was extirpated by a blight that was imported from Japan in the early 1900s. 
        I developed computerized simulations to predict the fate of reintroduced blight-resistant American chestnut trees in the Appalachians. 
         I developed a tree physiology simulation module,  <a href="http://www.landis-ii.org/extensions/pnet-succession">PnET-Succession</a>,
        for the LANDIS-II Forest Landscape Simulation Model and wrote comprehensive technical documentation that I have kept up to date during the development process.

            I supported the development of a biogeochemical simulation platform "MoBiLE". MoBiLE is a modular platform for biogeochemical

      It received my M.S. in Forestry and Environmental Sciences from Wageningen University based on a custom study plan best described as 
      "Mathematical Ecology", meaning that I had a large amound of mathematics, statistics and quantitative
      ecology in my program. I combined my study at Wageningen University with a study of Philosophy of Science at Amsterdam University.

   This was my second study on Philosophy of Science leading to the title of M.A. The study contains a generic year with general topics such as 
   the history of philosophy, logic, knowledge theory.
   The specialisation year contains a master thesis and some specialization subjects.
